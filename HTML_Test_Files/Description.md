# Test Files

## Overview

Plain HTML tables generated by the pandas package.  See the python script `pandas_csv_to_html_util.py` for a simple script that takes a csv file and generates a table. Useful for testing purposes where it is often easer to generate initial data in Excel,googlesheets,libre calc, etc. 

1. CSV file - Holds the original table.

2. HTMLTablexxx.html files contain slices of the above csv files of 100, 1000 and 10000 rows.  There is also a 10 000 rows table but with only 2 columns.  This is to highlight the impact of rendering tables on the overall response time.  These files only contain the table with some class settings.

**Note:** Some of the cells have a deliberate errors in them for testing purposes.
